# Junior Autonomous Systems Engineer

Are you passionate about autonomous driving and smart city tech? We're looking for enthusiastic students to join our team and help us develop cutting-edge **autonomous driving solutions** for 1:10 scaled vehicles!

As an **Autonomous Systems Engineer**, you'll be diving into the world of algorithm development to make our vehicles fully autonomous, able to navigate through smart cities all around the world. You’ll be coding extensively in **Python**—where you will thoroughly review, implement, and learn to optimize code for performance and efficiency—with a bit of C++ thrown in for good measure. Your work will involve a unique **intersection of logic and perception**: developing algorithms first implemented on the Gazebo simulator using ROS and later validated in real-world testing in the VROOM lab, while also working on perception tasks including **YOLO, sensor fusion, and graph-based localization**. Additionally, you'll be supporting the development and testing of the **servers** that make up the backbone of our smart city infrastructure.

This position is part of our dedicated Junior team, which has grown significantly over the years — both in size and impact. Becoming a Junior member means joining a well-structured onboarding process designed to help you integrate smoothly into the team and built confidence and skills. You'll be exposed to a wide range of **progressively challenging tasks**, with the freedom to focus on what excites you most, as you will get a close look at every aspect of our technologies.
Most importantly, training and mentorship are at the heart of the Junior experience. You won't just be thrown into a task — you'll be guided step-by-step, learning real-world engineering practices and becoming familiar with the tools and methods we use every day.

Why join us? You'll have the opportunity to innovate and experiment with the latest technologies in autonomous driving and **smart city** infrastructure development. You'll collaborate and learn with a team of like-minded students, gaining valuable experience along the way. Most importantly, you'll see your work come to life in a dynamic, real-world environment.

Sounds exciting? Be a part of our team and let’s drive the future of autonomous engineering technologies!

# Hardware Engineer
Are you excited about building real systems and seeing your designs come to life? We're looking for enthusiastic students to join our team and help us develop the hardware behind our 1:10 scale autonomous vehicles and the smart infrastructure that supports them!

As a Hardware Engineer, you’ll dive into the world of **electronics**, mechanical design, and rapid prototyping. You’ll be working on a variety of hands-on tasks that bring our systems to life — from **3D designing** and **printing** custom parts for vehicles using **Solidworks**, to **creating and assembling PCBs** and **integrating components** such as sensors, converters and controllers. 

While the work is hands-on, you're never on your own. Whether it's a sensor that needs troubleshooting, a power module behaving unpredictably or a signal that just doesn’t look quite right, you’ll be called to **identify the issue and help find a working solution** — learning how to approach real hardware problems with practical thinking. For this reason, you'll be a critical support resource for the autonomous systems engineering team. You will collaborate closely with them to **troubleshoot** setbacks, configure systems, and verify that **every hardware component performs reliably under rigorous real-world conditions**.

Why join us?
Through experimentation and collaboration, you’ll start to develop the mindset of an engineer  who thinks creatively, practically, and systematically when challenges arise. These aren’t just support tasks — they are where some of the most meaningful learning happens, giving you confidence to tackle real-world engineering problems beyond the lab.
